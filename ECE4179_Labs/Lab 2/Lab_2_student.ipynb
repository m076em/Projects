    "### Training with Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent, sometimes also referred to as _steepest descent_, is a popular first-order iterative optimisation method that has become ubiquitous in the machine and deep learning context. As you have heard in the lecture, the idea is to find the local minimum of a differentiable function by repeatedly taking steps in the opposite direction of the gradient of the function at the current point - i.e. in the direction of its steepest descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section of the lab, you are going to implement the **Gradient Descent algorithm** as a function that we can use afterwards to train our logistic regression model!\n",
    "\n",
    "The main parts of the algorithm work as follows:\n",
    "- Initialise hyperparameters like step-size aka learning rate, and number of iterations\n",
    "- Randomly initialise the set of parameters $\\boldsymbol{w}_{init}$ that shall be optimised\n",
    "- For a certain number of iterations, do:\n",
    "    - Obtain the prediction using the current weights $\\boldsymbol{w}_i$ and training data $\\boldsymbol{X}_{train}$\n",
    "    - Compute the loss $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{CE}}$ and the gradient vector $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{w}}\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{CE}}$ w.r.t. the current parameters $\\boldsymbol{w}_i$\n",
    "    - Update the parameters using the gradient vector and learning rate _lr_\n",
    "- After all iterations are finished, return the final optimised set of parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we ask you to also:\n",
    "- Return a list of all losses (one value for each iteration)\n",
    "- Return a list of all gradient vectors (one vector for each iteration)\n",
    "- Implement an option via the argument \"logging\" to switch on printing a string containing the 'iteration' and the 'loss' for each iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the initial set of parameters $\\boldsymbol{w}_{init}$, the hyperparameters as well as the training data $\\boldsymbol{X}_{train}$ and labels $\\boldsymbol{y}_{train}$ are passed as input arguments to your function."
